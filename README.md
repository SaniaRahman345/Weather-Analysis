# Weather-Analysis
  ## Overview
This project, written in Python, uses the NumPy and Pandas libraries for weather analysis. It encompasses data loading, analysis, and visualization to derive insights from weather data.
## Features
Data Loading: Utilizes Pandas for efficient weather data loading.
Data Analysis: Employs NumPy and Pandas for comprehensive data analysis.
# Your Goals 
clean the data remove unwanted rows and columns and then find the insights from data.
how many time the weather is clear on what conditions. 
how many time the weather is foggy.
All Unique Wind Speed (km/h) in data
when Weather is exactly clear
Wind Speed was exactly 4km/h
### Rename the Column Name 'Summary' to 'Weather Condition
# Mean Value of Visibility
Standard Deviation of Pressure (millibars)
Varience of Humidity
When Weather was Foggy
Wind speed is above 10 and Visibility is 10
Mean Value of each column against each weather Condition
Min & Max Value of each column against each weather condition
Weather iS Clear and visibility is above 40
# Find ALL Instances where:
A: Weather is clear and humidity is greater than 50
    or
B: Visibility is above 40
